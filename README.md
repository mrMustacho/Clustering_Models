Data Mining: techniques and algorithms
================

## Introduction

In the following docs we will observe different techniques used in Data
Mining. These techniques will be reviewed using R,a language and
environment for statistical computing and graphics, more about
[here](https://www.r-project.org/about.html).

## Table of contents

  - **Outliers Detection**:
      - *coming soon*
  - **Clustering**:
      - [GMM: Gaussian Mixture Model](./docs/gmm.html) *to be done*
      - K-means *to be done*
      - KNN: K-Nearest Neighbor *coming soon*
      - Fuzzy C-Means *coming soon*
      - DBSCAN *coming soon*

## Disclaimer

Iâ€™m no data scientist, so expect amateurish errors and superficial
understanding of each model. I hope that at least some chunks of code,
like the plots, are helpful to you.
